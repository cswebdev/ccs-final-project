Order needs a relationship to clothing item. The clothing item has a relationship to the donator and a purchaser

In addition to the user, there needs to be a drop off or pickup site that I could add





model for clothes with options

model for users
    possible profile model
phone number required for 
blocked user models

model for order

model for message
    Use Trello for user messaging and 
    https://trello.com/
    masking phone number

Users have the ability to flag users for harassment 
implement block/report users model

Admin has the ability to report and ban people. Moderation is important 
I can focus on Greenville for the shipping aspect. User saftey is going to be priority.



Game plan: from hardest to least hardest: 
- users upload items
    implementing forms and choices
